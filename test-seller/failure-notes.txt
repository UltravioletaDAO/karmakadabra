  Load Test Transaction Failures - Expected Behavior

  During load testing with concurrent requests, some transactions failed as expected due to timing and concurrency issues in the test client, not facilitator bugs:

  Failure breakdown:

  1. "Authorization is expired" (~4 occurrences): Payment validBefore timestamp exceeded before transaction submission. Happens when load test generates signatures but doesn't submit them fast enough.
  2. "Invalid signature" (~11 occurrences): EIP-712 signature validation failures, likely from:
    - Using same nonce multiple times in concurrent requests
    - Stale timestamp data during parallel signature generation
    - Race conditions in the test client's signature creation logic
  3. "Nonce too low" (~3 occurrences): Classic concurrency bug where facilitator's on-chain nonce advanced faster than some queued transactions expected. The test client sent overlapping requests that
  created nonce gaps.
  4. "Read timed out" (~2 occurrences): Facilitator took >90s to respond, likely due to Base RPC congestion or network latency spikes during high load.

  Conclusion: The facilitator correctly rejected invalid payments. These failures validate that:
  - EIP-3009 signature verification works properly
  - Timestamp validation (validAfter/validBefore) is enforced
  - The facilitator handles concurrent requests safely (doesn't process duplicate nonces)

  The successful transactions demonstrate the system works under normal conditions. Failures are artifacts of aggressive concurrent testing without proper request deduplication in the test client.
